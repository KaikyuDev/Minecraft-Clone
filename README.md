# ScrausoCraft
Don't care about the nameâ„¢

**ScarusoCraft** is really simple Minecraft clone made by me.
It has actually no utility, i've made it for two reasons:
* It was an **hard** project;
* I wanted to learn a bit of **OpenGL** and how games actually works.

That's all.

## Dependencies
There are some obvious dependencies:
* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) Simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.
* [GLFW3](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html) The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
* [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) OpenGL Mathematics

That's it! 


## Building
This project was not inteded for public usage, but if you want to try it out, you can build it.
Or you can use the **prebuilt executable**.
